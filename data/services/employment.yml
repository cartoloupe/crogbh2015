# lines starting with pound characters are comments
#
# lines starting with hyphens are list items
#
# indentation happens in multiples of 2 spaces.
#
# phone numbers and addresses may be single entries or lists.
# single entries belong on the same line.
# lists belong indented starting on the next line.
# some examples:
#
#    address: 1 Lonely Avenue, Columbus, OH
#
# or
#
#    address:
#      - 123 First Address Road, Columbus, OH
#      - 456 Second Address Place, Columbus, OH
#
# if you have a long block of text that would be hard to read
# in this yaml file, you may use the pipe character as a value,
# and then use an indented block to write as many lines as you need.
# an example:
#
#     description: |
#       This is a really long description that is going to look
#       awkward if I jam it all onto one line so I've decided to
#       use a multi-line block.
#
# this file is one giant list of objects, so make sure each
# entry begins with a single hyphen, followed by all the attributes
# you'd like to include in the object.
#
# the currently available attributes are:
#   title               required
#   description         required
#   phone               optional    single entry or list
#   mailing_address     optional    single entry or list
#   physical_address    optional    single entry or list
