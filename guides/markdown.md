# Quick Markdown Tutorial

## Introduction

Markdown is a simple way to provide markup in a text file that is
both compact and easy to use. In fact, these guides are written in
Markdown format. This guide is not meant to be comprehensive, but
should contain all of the basics we will be needing. If you need to
know how to do something else in Markdown, let me know and I'll add
an example to this file.

## Text

Plain text is the easiest thing to write in Markdown. You just write
the text. That's it. Successive lines will be concatenated unless
they are separated by a blank line. For example:

```
This is some text!
This is some more!

This is even more!
```

Becomes this:

This is some text! This is some more!

This is even more!

## Headings

Headings are lines that begin with one or more `#` characters.

```
# Primary Header
## Secondary Header
### Tertiary Header
#### Level 4 Header
##### Level 5 Header
###### Level 6 Header
```

Becomes this:

# Primary Header
## Secondary Header
### Tertiary Header
#### Level 4 Header
##### Level 5 Header
###### Level 6 Header

## Lists

Lists are groups of lines that each begin with a `*` character.
You must separate them from other content with blank lines.

```
### Example List

* First Item
* Second Item
* Third Item
```

Becomes this:

### Example List

* First Item
* Second Item
* Third Item

## Emphasis

There are two types of emphasis, weak and strong.
Weak emphasis begins and ends with a `*` character.
Strong emphasis begins and ends with two `**` characters.

```
*Weakly emphasized text*
**Strongly emphasized text**
```

Becomes this:

*Weakly emphasized text*
**Strongly emphasized text**
